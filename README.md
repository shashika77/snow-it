# snow-it
jQuery Snow Effect Script

This script was made when my boss wanted a snow effect on his website, looking around for script especially javascript, there's a heavy load on my old laptop and office pc, there's a good css script but a little bit off for installation.

So I made this js to accomodate my needs, and using js to create css animation for snow effects.

How to use :

1. add this to the head after jquery file

<script type="text/javascript" src="snow-it.min.js"></script>

2. add this code in document ready function

$.fn.snowit();

See index.html if you don't understand.
